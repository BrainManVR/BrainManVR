- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrainManVR
- 👀 I’m a neuroscientist interested in developing VR applications with Unity/C# to get brains working better
- 🌱 I’m currently learning networking for muliplayer experiences (PUN, Normcore, MIrror)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on virtual reality projects (which can make the world a better place) and not augmented reality (which will ultimate make daily living a privacy nightmare)
- 📫 How to reach me BrainManVR on IG, @drjacklewis on Twitter
